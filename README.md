First Odin Project

This project was done with no major challenge.
I have use flex display for the layouts.
The only obstacles I've accounted was the
logo might look very bad looking using safary
(can't find out the reason).

Credits:

1)Pexels: for all pictures used in this project;
2)Tresslesscountry.com: for the poem in the testimonial section. 3) Adobe Express: for the logo.
